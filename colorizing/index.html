            The goal of this project is to colorize the glass plate images from the 
            Prokudin-Gorskii collection, a library of RGB glass plate negatives 
            collected by Sergei Mikhailovich Prokudin-Gorskii. Sergei was a pioneer 
            of color photography well before color printing was even available, and he 
            traveled across Russia taking pictures of the country. During this time, he envisioned a 
            future of color photography where projectors would be able to display 
            these images across classrooms in Russia and Russian children could learn about their 
            vast country. All of the glass plate negatives that he generated are now 
            digitized in the Library of Congress. This project takes a selection of 
            RGB negatives from the collection and attempts to colorize them by aligning the 
            three glass plates provided for each image to form one colorized image depicting
            the scene Sergei captured on his camera hundreds of years ago.

        <p1> Low-Resolution Images:<br /></p1>
        <p1>
            To align the RGB color channels in the simple low-resolution case, I calculated the L2 norm between
            each pair of color channels, searching over a displacement shift of 15 pixels in each direction (top,
            left, right, and bottom) to find the alignment that resulted in the smallest L2 norm. Since the L2 
            norm calculates the difference between two input arrays, having a smaller L2 norm means that the 
            color intensities of each channel matches up most closely. For all images I tried, the L2 norm worked
            well for ensuring proper alignment of borders and edges across the different color channels.<br /><br />

        <p1> <br /><br /> High-Resolution Images:<br /></p1>
        <p1>
            For high-resolution images, alignment offsets required searching over more than just 15 pixels of 
            displacement in each direction and additionally, calculating one instance of L2 norm took much longer.
            As a result, I implemented a 5-level pyramid search scheme where I started with a downsized image that was 1/16th
            of the original resolution and continuously increased the resolution by a multiple of 2 until I reached
            the original high-def image. I noticed that running an exhaustive displacement search at each level over a 15-pixel 
            displacement range in each direction still took quite a few minutes, with the runtime severly bottlenecked at
            the lower layers (more high-def images). As a result, since the alignment was pretty much close to where it should
            have been after the top few layers, I used a modified displacement search heuristic to improve the runtime so that
            all images could be generated in under 30 seconds. This heuristic involved searching over a displacement size of 
            15 at level 1/16th resolution, 12 at level 1/8th resolution, 9 at level 1/4th resolution, 4 at level 1/2 resolution,
            and 2 at level 1 resolution. This modified heuristic improved the runtime drastically but there were some images that
            had marginally lower alignment quality. On the whole, almost all images performed decently well but some of the high-resolution
            images had a slightly misaligned green channel. This is probably due to the fact that I had aligned the green and red 
            channels first before attempting to align both onto the blue channel. For the most part, implementing auto-cropping of the 
            borders fixed most alignment issues, but I'll talk a bit more about that in the Bells & Whistles section.<br /><br />

        <p1>
            For the extra image preprocessing, I implemented automatic cropping of the borders. To do so, I did two separate steps of 
            cropping: 1) crop the noticeable white/black edges from each of the three color channels before aligning and 2) finetune the 
            cropping of the final colored image. Step 1 worked very well in helping the color channel alignment better align to the edges 
            of the objects in the image rather than being skewed by aligning to the border edges. However, I noticed that even after step 1
            cropping, the final colored image still retains some noticeable borders especially when there are colored lines due to slight alignment
            shifts along the edges of the color channel. To remedy this, step 2 goes through the final colored image and performs cropping if 
            the border is very close to white or black and if the entire edge is approximately the same color according to my heuristic.
            <br /><br />
            The heuristic I used for determining whether or not to crop an edge was finalized after a couple experiments and testing. I found that 
            the best results occurred when I cropped according to the following rules for each part: <br /><br />

            Part 1 (done for each color channel):
            <ul>
                <li>Crop white edges if at least 40% of pixels in that row or column are within 0.05 of 1 (where 1 is no color in that pixel). </li>
                <li>Crop black edges if at least 40% of pixels in that row or column are within 0.2 of 0 (where 0 is full color in that pixel).</li>
            </ul>  
            Part 2 (done for the final colored image):
            <ul>
                <li>Crop white edges if the mean along each color channel of that row or column is within 0.05 of 1 (where 1 is white in that pixel). </li>
                <li>Crop black edges if the mean along each color channel of that row or column is within 0.2 of 0 (where 0 is black in that pixel).</li>
                <li>Crop the edge if at least 60% of values along the edge are within 0.15 of the mean for its corresponding color channel. (This checks for 
                    consistent bands of solid color that occurs along the edges sometimes due to edge alignment errors caused by boundary inaccuracies in the 
                    original input image).
                </li>
            </ul> 
        </p1>

            Looking at the auto-cropping results, we can see that for the most part, the cropping was noticeably succesful. Cropping was particularly good at removing
            the extra whitespace around the edges since those were all pretty much exactly white. Most of the black-edged borders were successfully cropped out except
            for certain cases like the right edge of church.tif, the left edge of emir.tif, the left edge of icon.tif, the left edge of melons.tif, the right edge of 
            three_generations.tif, and the borders of workshop.tif. In all of these cases, the black edging was not exactly black and displayed splotches or lines of 
            other colors which made it difficult for my heuristic to detect a solid black which represented the borders.
            But for the most part, autocropping was successful and in some cases even managed to detect solid color edges and remove them. This can be seen in tobolsk.jpg, 
            monastery.jpg, onion_church.tif, the top and bottom of three_generations.tif, the bottom of icons.tif, and the bottom and right of emir.tif, among others.
